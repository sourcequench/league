* come up with unit test for the aggregated diffs - results don't smell right after changing the adjustment method
* come up with a better way to extract data from Ken's spreadsheets to validate what I pulled from match scoresheets
* convert match history into a proto
* update glicko2_diff to end up using percent diff, and making race calculations along the way with UpdateMatches (a new version for glicko race calculation).
* write a function to give per-user aggregated diffs.
