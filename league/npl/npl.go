/*
In the NPL system, two players who are 30 points apart are expected to win games
in a 2:1 ratio on average. 60 points and itâ€™s 4:1, and so on. This is identical
to the Fargo probability scale except that the two systems scales are different
by a ratio of 30:100. In Fargo, if two players are 100 points apart they can be
expected to win in a 2:1 ratio. In the NPL the points difference is given by the
formula 100*log_10(p1/p2) and in Fargo it is 100*log_2(p1/p2) where p1 is the
chance player 1 will win a single game and p2 is the probability that player 2
will win a game. (p1+p2=1)
